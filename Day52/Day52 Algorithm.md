## Algorithm for Day 52 **Reverse First K elements of Queue**

1. **Define the Solution class:**
   - Define a class named `Solution` containing a method to modify the given queue by reversing the first `k` elements.

2. **modifyQueue Method:**
   - Define the `modifyQueue` method, which takes a list `q` (queue) and an integer `k` as input and returns the modified queue.

3. **Reversing the First k Elements:**
   - Return the modified queue by concatenating two parts:
     - The first part is the reversed version of the first `k` elements of the queue, obtained by slicing `q` up to index `k` (`q[:k]`) and reversing it (`[::-1]`).
     - The second part is the rest of the queue after index `k`, obtained by slicing `q` starting from index `k` (`q[k:]`).

4. **End of Algorithm.**
