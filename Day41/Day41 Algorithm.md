## Algorithm for Day 41 **Array Pair Sum Divisibility Problem**

1. **Define the Solution class:**
   - Define a class named `Solution` containing a method to determine if pairs of numbers in a list can be formed such that their sum is divisible by `k`.

2. **canPair Method:**
   - Define the `canPair` method which takes two parameters: `nums` (a list of integers) and `k` (an integer).

3. **Initialize Modulus Counter:**
   - Create a list `mods` of size `k` initialized with zeros. This list will store the frequency of remainders when dividing each number in `nums` by `k`.

4. **Count Remainders:**
   - Iterate through each number in `nums`.
   - Increment the count of the corresponding remainder's index in the `mods` list.

5. **Check for Pairs:**
   - Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to 1 and `k - 1` respectively.
   - Iterate while `i` is less than `j`:
     - If the frequency of remainders at positions `i` and `j` are not equal, return False.
     - Increment `i` and decrement `j`.

6. **Check Special Cases:**
   - Ensure that the frequency of remainders at index 0 is even.
   - If `k` is odd or the frequency of remainders at index `k // 2` is even, return True.

7. **Return Result:**
   - If the conditions in step 6 are met, return True, indicating that pairs can be formed.
   - Otherwise, return False.

8. **End of Algorithm.**
