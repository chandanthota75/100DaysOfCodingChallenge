# 100 Days of Code Challenge - GeekforGeeks 🎉

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge journey with GeekforGeeks! 🚀

This repository contains my solutions to the daily coding challenges from GeekforGeeks, completed during the 100 Days of Code Challenge from November 22nd, 2023 to February 29th, 2024.

## About ℹ️

During this challenge, I completed coding exercises and problems provided by GeekforGeeks on a daily basis. The solutions are written in Python programming language.

## Repository Structure 📁

The repository is organized into folders for each day of the challenge. Each folder contains:

- A Markdown file (`DayX Question.md`) with the problem statement for the respective day.
- An Algorithm description file (`DayX Algorithm.md`) providing an overview of the approach used to solve the problem.
- Python files (`DayX Python Solution.py`) containing the solutions to the problems.

## Daily Progress 📅

- [Day 1: Symmetric Tree](Day1/)
  - Check whether a Binary Tree is symmetric.
- Day 2: [To be updated]
  - [Description of the problem for Day 2]
- Day 3: [To be updated]
  - [Description of the problem for Day 3]
- ...

## Getting Started 🚀

Feel free to explore the solutions for each day's challenge by navigating through the respective folders. You can review the problem statement in the Markdown file, understand the algorithm approach in the Algorithm.md file, and examine the Python solution provided.
