## Algorithm for Day 98 **Play With OR**

1. **Define the Solution class:**
   - Define a class named `Solution` containing a method to modify an array.

2. **game_with_number Method:**
   - Define the `game_with_number` method which takes two parameters: `arr` (the input array) and `n` (the length of the array).
   - This method modifies the input array based on a given operation.

3. **Iterative Modification:**
   - Iterate over the elements of the array up to the second last element (index `i` from 0 to `n - 2`):
     - Perform a bitwise OR operation (`|=`) between the current element `arr[i]` and the next element `arr[i + 1]`.
     - Update the current element `arr[i]` with the result of the bitwise OR operation.

4. **Return Modified Array:**
   - After completing the modification loop, return the modified array `arr`.

5. **End of Algorithm.**
