## Algorithm for Day 56 **Sequence of Sequence**

1. **Define the Solution class:**
   - Define a class named `Solution` containing a method to compute a number sequence.

2. **numberSequence Method:**
   - Define the `numberSequence` method, which takes the following parameters:
     - `m`: An integer representing the current number in the sequence.
     - `n`: An integer representing the position in the sequence.
   - The method returns an integer representing the value at position `n` in the sequence.

3. **Recursion Approach:**
   - If `m` is less than `n`, return 0, as the sequence cannot be generated.
   - If `n` is 0, return 1, as the sequence starts from 1.
   - The sequence is generated based on the following logic:
     - To get the value at position `n` in the sequence, the method recursively calls itself with updated parameters:
       - `self.numberSequence(m / 2, n - 1)`: This computes the value at position `n - 1` in the sequence where `m` is halved.
       - `self.numberSequence(m - 1, n)`: This computes the value at position `n` in the sequence where `m` is decremented by 1.
   - The result is the sum of the values computed by the two recursive calls.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the result obtained from the recursive calls.
