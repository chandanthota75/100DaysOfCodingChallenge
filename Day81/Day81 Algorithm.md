## Algorithm for Day 81 **Number of paths in a matrix with k coins**

1. **Import `lru_cache` from functools:**
   - The code imports the `lru_cache` decorator from the `functools` module. It is used to memoize the results of function calls, which helps improve performance by avoiding redundant computations.

2. **Define the `Solution` Class:**
   - The `Solution` class contains a method named `numberOfPath` to calculate the number of paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid, given certain constraints.

3. **Method `numberOfPath`:**
   - This method uses recursive depth-first search (DFS) with memoization to calculate the number of paths.
   - It defines an inner function `dfs` that takes three parameters: `r` (current row), `c` (current column), and `k` (remaining energy).
   - The `dfs` function performs the following steps:
     - If the current position `(r, c)` is the bottom-right corner of the grid and `k` equals the energy at `(r, c)`, it returns 1, indicating that a valid path is found.
     - If `r` or `c` exceeds the grid boundaries or `k` becomes negative, it returns 0, indicating that no valid path exists from this position.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls `dfs` for the bottom and right positions while subtracting the energy at the current position from `k`.
     - The results of recursive calls are summed up to compute the total number of valid paths.
   - The `dfs` function is memoized using the `lru_cache` decorator to store and reuse computed results, which helps optimize the performance by avoiding redundant computations.
   - Finally, the method returns the result of the initial call to `dfs` with the starting position `(0, 0)` and the initial energy `k`.
