## Algorithm for Day 14 **Minimize the Heights II**

1. **Define the Solution class:**
   - Define a class named `Solution` containing a method to find the minimum possible difference between tower heights.

2. **getMinDiff Method:**
   - Define the `getMinDiff` method which takes three parameters: `arr` (list of tower heights), `n` (number of towers), and `k` (the value to be added or subtracted from each tower's height).
   - This method finds the minimum possible difference between tower heights after adding or subtracting `k` from each tower's height.

3. **Sort the Array:**
   - Sort the array `arr` in non-decreasing order using the `sort()` method.

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Get the length of the sorted array `n` and initialize variables `maxx`, `minn`, and `diff`.
   - Set `maxx` and `minn` initially to 0.
   - Calculate the initial difference between the heights of the tallest and shortest towers and store it in the variable `diff`.

5. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - Iterate through the sorted array using a for loop from `i = 0` to `n - 1`.
   - Check if the current tower height `arr[i]` is less than `k`. If so, continue to the next iteration.

6. **Update Maximum and Minimum Heights:**
   - Update the maximum possible height `maxx` by considering either adding `k` to the previous tower's height or subtracting `k` from the tallest tower's height.
   - Update the minimum possible height `minn` by considering either adding `k` to the shortest tower's height or subtracting `k` from the current tower's height.

7. **Update Minimum Difference:**
   - Update the minimum difference `diff` by taking the absolute difference between `maxx` and `minn` and storing the minimum value.

8. **Return Result:**
   - After iterating through all towers, return the minimum possible difference `diff` between tower heights.

9. **End of Algorithm.**
