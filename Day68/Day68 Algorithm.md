## Algorithm for Day 68 **Geekina Hate 1s**

1. **Import Required Libraries:**
   - Import `List` and `log2` from the `typing` module and `factorial` from the `math` module.

2. **Define the Solution Class:**
   - Define a class named `Solution` containing methods to solve the problem.

3. **comb Method:**
   - Define a method named `comb` to calculate the combinations (n choose r) using the factorial formula.
   - Return the result.

4. **count_exact Method:**
   - Define a method named `count_exact` to count the exact number of integers in a sequence.
   - If k is 0, return 1.
   - If a is 0, return 0.
   - Calculate m as the integer part of the base-2 logarithm of a.
   - If m is less than k-1, return 0.
   - Return the sum of combinations (m choose k) and the result of recursively calling `count_exact` with parameters (a XOR (1 shifted left by m)), and (k-1).

5. **count Method:**
   - Define a method named `count` to count the number of integers in a sequence for each value of k.
   - Return the sum of `count_exact` for k ranging from 0 to k.

6. **findNthNumber Method:**
   - Define a method named `findNthNumber` to find the nth number in the sequence.
   - Initialize the lower bound `lo` to 0 and the upper bound `hi` to 10^18.
   - Use binary search to find the nth number:
     - Calculate the mid value.
     - If the count of integers less than or equal to mid for a given k is greater than or equal to n, update hi to mid.
     - Otherwise, update lo to mid + 1.
   - Return the lower bound `lo` as the result.

7. **End of Algorithm.**
