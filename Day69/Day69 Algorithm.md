## Algorithm for Day 69 **Count digit groupings of a number**

1. **Import Required Libraries:**
   - Import `lru_cache` from the `functools` module.

2. **Define the Solution Class:**
   - Define a class named `Solution` containing the `TotalCount` method.

3. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Calculate the length of the string `s` and initialize a 2D array `sums` with dimensions nxn, where n is the length of the string.
   - Initialize each element of `sums` to 0.

4. **Calculate Prefix Sums:**
   - Use nested loops to calculate the prefix sums for all substrings of `s`.
   - Iterate over the length `l` of substrings.
   - Iterate over the range of `r` from `l` to `n`.
   - If `l == r`, set the `sums[l][r]` to the integer value of `s[r]`.
   - Otherwise, calculate the sum of elements from `l` to `r` and store it in `sums[l][r]`.

5. **Define the Recursive Function:**
   - Use memoization with the `lru_cache` decorator to cache the results of recursive calls.
   - Define a function named `count` that takes the previous number `prev_n` and the index `i` as parameters.
   - If `i` equals `n`, return 1, indicating that a valid combination is found.
   - Initialize `ret` to 0, which stores the count of valid combinations.
   - Iterate over the range of `r` from `i` to `n`.
   - If the sum of elements from `i` to `r` is greater than or equal to `prev_n`, recursively call `count` with the new `prev_n` and `r+1`, and add the result to `ret`.
   - Return `ret`.

6. **Return the Result:**
   - Invoke the `count` function with initial parameters `0` and `0`.
   - Return the result.

7. **End of Algorithm.**
