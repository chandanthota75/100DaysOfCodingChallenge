## Algorithm for Day 84 **Clone an Undirected Graph**

1. **Define the Node class:**
   - Define a class named `Node` representing nodes in a graph.
   - Each node has two attributes: `val` (value of the node) and `neighbors` (a list of neighboring nodes).

2. **Define the Solution class:**
   - Define a class named `Solution` containing a method to clone a graph.

3. **cloneGraph Method:**
   - Define the `cloneGraph` method which takes a node `node` as input and returns a cloned graph.
   - This method clones the given graph.

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Import the `setrecursionlimit` function from the `sys` module and set the recursion limit to 10^4 to avoid reaching the recursion limit during traversal.
   - Initialize an empty dictionary `corr` to store mappings between original and cloned nodes.
   - Initialize a queue `q` with the given `node` as its only element for breadth-first traversal.

5. **Breadth-First Traversal:**
   - While the queue `q` is not empty:
     - Pop the current node `cur` from the queue.
     - Create a new node `ne` in the `corr` dictionary corresponding to the current node `cur`.
     - Iterate through each neighbor `nxt` of the current node `cur`:
       - If the neighbor node `nxt` is not already present in the `corr` dictionary:
         - Add the neighbor node `nxt` to the queue for further exploration.

6. **Clone the Graph:**
   - Iterate through each node `ex` and its corresponding cloned node `ne` in the `corr` dictionary:
     - Set the value of the cloned node `ne` equal to the value of the original node `ex`.
     - Update the neighbors of the cloned node `ne` by mapping each original neighbor node `x` to its corresponding cloned node in the `corr` dictionary.

7. **Return Result:**
   - Return the cloned node corresponding to the given `node`.
