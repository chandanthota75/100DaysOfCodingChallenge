## Algorithm for Day 86 **Traverse All Edges And Vertices**

1. **Define the Solution class:**
   - Define a class named `Solution` containing a method to determine if it's possible to form a path.

2. **isPossible Method:**
   - Define the `isPossible` method which takes a list of paths `paths` as input.
   - This method checks if it's possible to form a path with the given list of paths.

3. **Check Each Path:**
   - Iterate through each path `i` in the list of paths `paths`.
   - For each path `i`, count the occurrences of 1 in the path:
     - If the count is odd, return 0 immediately as it's not possible to form a path with an odd number of occurrences of 1.
     - If the count is even, continue to the next path.

4. **Return Result:**
   - If all paths have an even number of occurrences of 1, return 1 indicating that it's possible to form a path.

5. **End of Algorithm.**
