## Algorithm for Day 92 **Boolean Parenthesization**

1. **Define the Solution class:**
   - Define a class named `Solution` containing a method to count the number of ways to evaluate the expression to True.

2. **countWays Method:**
   - Define the `countWays` method which takes two parameters: `n` (length of the string `s`) and `s` (the string containing the expression).
   - This method counts the number of ways to evaluate the expression to True.

3. **Import Libraries:**
   - Import the `lru_cache` decorator from the `functools` module to memoize the results of function calls.

4. **Define Helper Function:**
   - Define a nested function named `count(i, j, result)` to recursively count the number of ways to evaluate the expression to a given result, where `i` and `j` represent the start and end indices of the current substring, and `result` is a boolean indicating whether the expression should evaluate to True or False.
   - Memoize the function calls using the `lru_cache` decorator to improve performance.

5. **Base Case:**
   - If the start index `i` is equal to the end index `j`:
     - If the current substring equals 'T' and the expected result is True, return 1.
     - If the current substring equals 'F' and the expected result is False, return 1.
     - Otherwise, return 0.

6. **Iterate Through Operators:**
   - Iterate through the substring from index `i` to index `j` with a step size of 2 (to consider only the operators).
   - For each operator at index `k`:
     - If the operator is '&':
       - Recursively count the number of ways to evaluate both left and right substrings to True if the expected result is True.
       - Recursively count the number of ways to evaluate both left and right substrings to True, False, or False, True if the expected result is False.
     - If the operator is '|':
       - Recursively count the number of ways to evaluate both left and right substrings to True, True, or False, True if the expected result is True.
       - Recursively count the number of ways to evaluate both left and right substrings to False if the expected result is False.
     - If the operator is '^':
       - Recursively count the number of ways to evaluate both left and right substrings to True, False, or False, True if the expected result is True.
       - Recursively count the number of ways to evaluate both left and right substrings to False, False, or True, True if the expected result is False.

7. **Return Result:**
   - Return the result modulo 1003.

8. **End of Algorithm.**
