## Algorithm for Day 58 **Water the Plants**

1. **Define the Solution class:**
   - Define a class named `Solution` containing a method to find the minimum number of sprinklers required.

2. **min_sprinklers Method:**
   - Define the `min_sprinklers` method, which takes the following parameters:
     - `gallery`: A list containing the gallery information where `-1` represents a wall and other integers represent the range of sprinklers.
     - `n`: An integer representing the length of the gallery.
   - The method returns the minimum number of sprinklers required to cover the entire gallery, or `-1` if it's not possible.

3. **Initialize the Limit List:**
   - Iterate over the `gallery` list and for each non-wall position (`gallery[i] != -1`), calculate the range of the sprinkler coverage and store it in the `limit` list as a tuple `[start, end]`.

4. **Sort the Limit List:**
   - Sort the `limit` list based on the starting positions of the sprinkler coverage.

5. **Iterate Through the Sorted Limits:**
   - Initialize variables `sprinklers`, `i`, and `start`.
   - Iterate while the `start` position is less than the length of the gallery.
   - Inside the loop, find the maximum coverage range `max_range` that can be achieved by placing the sprinklers.
   - If `max_range` is less than `start`, return `-1` as it's not possible to cover the entire gallery.
   - Increment the `sprinklers` count and update the `start` position to `max_range + 1`.

6. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the minimum number of sprinklers required to cover the entire gallery.

7. **End of Algorithm.**
